# Notes: 

This is an example of a simple implementation of Serverless Framework to deploy an AWS Lambada with an HTTP endpoint and an SQS Queue. Source: `https://github.com/serverless` 

The folder of Github Actions Example contains the .yml files to execute both the deployment and removal of the Stack required to deploy this example application.

To run this example you will need to create `./.github/workflows/*` and place there the files to execute the Github actions. Also, you will need to provide both an AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and an AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as secrets in the repo configuration to authenticate to AWS.

# Serverless Framework Python SQS Producer-Consumer on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple SQS-based producer-consumer service running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework and the [Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift) plugin. It allows to accept messages, for which computation might be time or resource intensive, and offload their processing to an asynchronous background process for a faster and more resilient system.

## Anatomy of the template

This template defines one function `producer` and one Lift construct - `jobs`. The producer function is triggered by `http` event type, accepts JSON payloads and sends it to a SQS queue for asynchronous processing. The SQS queue is created by the `jobs` queue construct of the Lift plugin. The queue is set up with a "dead-letter queue" (to receive failed messages) and a `worker` Lambda function that processes the SQS messages.

To learn more:

- about `http` event configuration options, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/)
- about the `queue` construct, refer to [the `queue` documentation in Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift/blob/master/docs/queue.md)
- about the Lift plugin in general, refer to [the Lift project](https://github.com/getlift/lift)
- about SQS processing with AWS Lambda, please refer to the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then deploy:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Excluding development dependencies...
Serverless: Creating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
........
Serverless: Stack create finished...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service aws-python-sqs-worker.zip file to S3 (21.44 MB)...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...

Service Information
service: aws-python-sqs-worker
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: aws-python-sqs-worker-dev
resources: 17
api keys:
  None

  POST - https://xxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/produce

layers:
  None
jobs:
  queueUrl: https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xxxx/aws-python-sqs-worker-dev-jobs
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can now call the created API endpoint with `POST` request to invoke `producer` function:

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://xxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/produce' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"name": "John"}'
```

In response, you should see output similar to:

```bash
{"message": "Message accepted!"}
```

### Bundling dependencies

In case you would like to include 3rd party dependencies, you will need to use a plugin called `serverless-python-requirements`. You can set it up by running the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Running the above will automatically add `serverless-python-requirements` to `plugins` section in your `serverless.yml` file and add it as a `devDependency` to `package.json` file. The `package.json` file will be automatically created if it doesn't exist beforehand. Now you will be able to add your dependencies to `requirements.txt` file (`Pipfile` and `pyproject.toml` is also supported but requires additional configuration) and they will be automatically injected to Lambda package during build process. For more details about the plugin's configuration, please refer to [official documentation](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).
